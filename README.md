# IFC for Revit and Navisworks (revit-ifc)

This is the .NET code used by Revit and Revit LT 2019 and later to support IFC. The open-source version overrides the standard version shipped with Revit and its updates. This contains the source code for Link IFC, IFC export, and the IFC export UI. This also works to improve Navisworks import.

_An archive of the original SourceForge forums can be found [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/ifcexporter/discussion/)._

***Note: The most current annual version and two previous versions are supported with fixes/changes. Older versions will not be supported.***

## Releases
The latest addon downloads and Release Notes can be found here: [Releases](https://github.com/Autodesk/revit-ifc/releases). New versions of the addon, from 2023 and later, should also be available in the Autodesk Desktop App (ADA) as per your user and license settings.

## Issue Submission Templates
When submitting an Issue, users will be asked to choose between the following submission templates:
- **Problem Report [PR]**: _is a "bug", error, or issue found during the use of any aspect of the IFC functionality._
- **Enhancement Request [ENH]**: _a proposed change to improve functionality, user interface (UI), and/or experience (UX)_
- **Inquiry [INQ]**: _a question about functionality and/or UI/UX but not a Problem or an Enhancement_

This will assist the development team with triaging and prioritizing reports.

## Labels
GitHub labels are used to classify the nature of the Issue and help developers group, sort, and prioritize them. <!-- The **Triage** label is automatically added when reporting an issue.--> Reporting users and staff can add or edit labels. To make the triage and reporting process faster and easier (may also mean getting your issues addressed with higher priority), please use the **Labels** to classify the nature of the Issue to the best of your knowledge.

### Version Label
- 2024
- 2023
- 2022
- ... *(will expand as more versions are released)*

### Component Labels
- API
- coordinate system
- documentation
- export 
- geometry 
- GUID
- IFC mapping
- import
- parameters-properties 
- performance
- UI/UX 

More Labels of this type can be added as needed/requested by users and developers, but this should be a relatively simple list to make high-level sorting and identifying quicker and easier.

### Status Labels
(set by Autodesk Developers) 
- Rejected 
- In progress (a formal bug has been filed internally. No formal commitment on when/how)
- Cannot reproduce (unable to reproduce the error on our side)
- Duplicate (will try to link to similar Issues)
- Feedback (additional feedback from the reporter is required)
- Fixed 
- Triage (initial state of labeling and determining priority)

Ideally, each Issue should include Version and Component labels from the reporting user. The Autodesk developers will verify and correct those labels if needed, as well as add a Status label. Developers may also add an internal Autodesk Jira number/link to an Issue, but this is for internal reference and tracking only and not accessible to the general public.
