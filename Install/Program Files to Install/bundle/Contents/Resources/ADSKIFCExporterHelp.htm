<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
This application seamlessly replaces the built-in IFC mechanism.  Please use the standard IFC import and export UI to access this functionality.</p>

The export alternate interface is loaded when users access the Export functionality using Revit UI. This alternate interface offers a flexible set of options to configure the export. The options include:</p>
<p>
<p><strong>IFC version</strong>:</p>
<menu>
<li>IFC 2x3 Coordination View 2.0</li>
<li>IFC 2x3 Coordination View</li>
<li>IFC 2x2 Coordination View</li>
<li>IFC 2x3 GSA Concept Design BIM 2010 – This is a variant of the standard IFC 2x3 used for submitting files to the US Government Services Administration.  Additional property sets will be included.</li> 
<li>IFC 4 Reference View - This version is buildingSMART IFC certification (IFC4 RV 1.2) certified version for Architectural and Structural export Exchange Requirements. MEP export and Import are still on-going</li>
<li>IFC 4 Design Transfer View</li>
</menu>
<p><strong>Exchange Requirement</strong>: Exchange Requirements (only for IFC4 Reference View)</p>
<menu><li>Architectural Reference Exchange</li>
<li>Structural Reference Exchange</li>
<li>MEP Reference Exchange</li>
<p><strong>File Type</strong>: The file format</p>
<menu><li>IFC</li>
<li>IFC XML</li>
<li>Zipped IFC</li>
<li>Zipped IFC XML</li></menu>
<p><strong>Phase to export</strong>: Selects the phase of the document to export, defaulting to the last phase of the document.  If "Export only elements visible in view" is selected, the phase of the view will be used and this option greyed out.</p>
<p><strong>Space boundaries</strong>: The level of room/space boundaries exported:</p>
<menu>
<li>None – room/space boundaries are not exported</li>
<li>1st level – the room/space boundaries are included but are not optimized to split elements with respect to spaces on the opposite side of the boundary</li>
<li>2nd level – the room/space boundaries are included and are split with respect to spaces on the opposite side of the boundary</li>
</menu>
<p><strong>Coordinate Base</strong>: The origin of the exported file.  Can be one of:</p>
<menu>
<li>Shared Coordinates (default)</li>
<li>Survey Point</li>
<li>Project Base Point</li>
<li>Internal Origin</li>
</menu>
<p><strong>Projected Coordinate System Reference</strong>: Map/GIS Projected Coordinate System used:</p>
<menu>
		  <li>Name: the name of the Projected Coordinate System. Auto-populated based on the EPSG Code in the model or user input</li>
		  <li>Description: description of the Projected Coordinate System. It is auto-populated</li>
		  <li>EPSG Code: the EPSG Code. It is pre-populated if the Revit file has SiteLocation information, otherwise user input</li>
		  <li>Geodetic Datum: the geodetic datum used. It is Auto-populated</li>
		  <li>Eastings: the Easting. It is updated based on the Coordinate Based selected. For a proper geo-reference export, use either Project Based Point or Survey Point</li>
		  <li>Northings: the Northing. It is updated based on the Coordinate Based selected. For a proper geo-reference export, use either Project Based Point or Survey Point</li>
		  <li>Reset (button). It resets the Projected Coordinate System setting to the original values</li>
</menu>
<p><strong>Split walls and columns by Level</strong>: Whether or not to split walls and columns by building stories.</p>
<p><strong>Include Steel Elements</strong>: Export Steel connection elements</p>

<p><strong>Export 2D plan view elements</strong>: Checked to include 2D elements supported by IFC export (notes and filled regions), unchecked to exclude them. </p>
<p><strong>Export Linked Files as Separate IFCs</strong>: Checked to export any Revit links in the project as separate IFCs, unchecked to exclude them.  Each linked instance in the file will export as a separate IFC file with the right positioning relative to the host file.  Multiple instances of the same linked document will export as separate files, identical except for their position and orientation.  Note that linked IFC files will be re-exported, so may suffer data loss on roundtrip.</p>
<p><strong>Export only elements visible in view</strong>: Checked to export only the visible elements of the current view (based on filtering and/or element and category hiding), unchecked to export the entire model.</p>
<p><strong>Export rooms, areas and spaces in 3D views</strong>: If the "export only elements visible in view" is checked, checking this option will export all of the rooms that are contained inside the section box of the selected 3D view.  If there is no active section box, all rooms will be exported.

<p><strong>Export Revit property sets</strong>: Checked to include the Revit-specific property sets based on parameter groups.  Unchecked to exclude them.</p>
<p><strong>Export IFC Common property sets</strong>: Checked to include the IFC common property sets, unchecked to exclude them.</p>
<p><strong>Export base quantities</strong>: Whether or not to include base quantities for model elements in the export data.  Base quantities are generated from model geometry to reflect actual physical quantity values, independent of measurement rules or methods.</p>
<p><strong>Export Schedules as property sets</strong>: Checked to export schedules as custom property sets.  The name of the schedule is the property set name; the column names are the IFC parameter names.</p>
<p><strong>Export only schedules containing IFC, Pset, or Common in the title</strong>: When checked, restricts the schedules exported to only those that contain "IFC", "PSet", or "Common" in their title.
<p><strong>Export user defined property sets</strong>: Checked to export user-defined property set.  If checked, the use can specify the name of a text file that contains the property set definitions.</p>
<p><strong>Export parameter mapping table</strong>: Export parameter mapping table to a specified file</p>

<p><strong>Level of detail for some element geometry</strong>: Allows control of the level of tessellation for some Revit elements.  Disabling this option will generally result in larger, but more accurate, BRep and profile representations.  The main Revit elements affected by this control are: elbows, floors, pipe fittings, railings, ramps, spaces and stairs.  Highly detailed extrusion profiles are also affected.for these items.</p>

<p><strong>Export parts as building elements</strong>: Checked to export parts as standard IFC elements, Unchecked to export them as IfcBuildingElementPart.</p>
<p><strong>Allow use of mixed "Solid Model" representation</strong>: Checked to allow for mixing BRep and extrusion geometries for an entity.  This can result in smaller IFC files, but which are not strictly within the standard IFC MVDs.</p>
<p><strong>Use active view when creating geometry</strong>: This option exports the geometry according to the view including view constrained using section box</p>
<p><strong>Use family and type name for references</strong>: Checked to use the family and type name for references, unchecked to use the type name only.</p>
<p><strong>Use 2D room boundaries for room volume</strong>: Checked to use a simplified approach to calculation of room volumes (based on extrusion of 2D room boundaries) which is also the default when exporting to IFC 2x2.   Unchecked to use the Revit calculated room geometry to represent the room volumes (which is the default when exporting to IFC 2x3).</p>
<p><strong>Include IFCSITE elevation in the site local placement origin</strong>: Checked to include the elevation from the Z offset of the IFCSITE local placement, unchecked to exclude it.</p>
<p><strong>Store IFC GUID in file after export</strong>: Optionally allow storing the generated IFC GUIDs into the project file after export. This will add "IFC GUID" parameters to elements and their types, and Project Information for Project, Site, and Building GUIDS. This requires v2.12 of the exporter to add the parameter values, and also requires a manual save. 
</p>
<p><strong>Export Bounding Box</strong>: Checked to export bounding box representations, Unchecked to exclude them.  This is the default for GSA export.</p>
<p><strong>Keep Tessellated Geometry as Triangulation</strong>: This option will not optimize Brep to be exported as IfcPolygonalFaceSet in IFC4 RV export. This option may speed up export for models that have large and complex geometries</p>
<p><strong>Use Type name only for IFCType name</strong>: This option override the default type name using just the name of the type</p>
<p><strong>Use visible Revit name as the IFCEntity name</strong>: Ths option override the default element name using what shown in Revit as the object name</p>

<p>There are 10 built-in setups in the user interface:</p>    
<menu>
<li>IFC 2x3 Coordination View 2.0</li>
<li>IFC 2x3 Coordination View</li>
<li>IFC 2x3 GSA Concept Design BIM 2010</li>
<li>IFC 2x3 Basic FM Handover View</li>
<li>IFC 2x2 Coordination View</li>
<li>IFC 2x3 COBie 2.4 Design Deliverable</li>
<li>IFC 4 Reference View [Architecture]</li>
<li>IFC 4 Reference View [Structural]</li>
<li>IFC 4 Reference View [BuildingService]</li>
<li>IFC 4 Design Transfer View</li>

</menu>
    <p>These correspond to the file type options in the standard Revit UI. When selected, the individual options will adjust accordingly. 
    These setups cannot be modified or deleted, but they can be duplicated in order to create a modified version.</p>
    <p>The “In-Session Setup” is a modifiable setup which will not be saved between sessions. You can configure the options as desired.</p>
    <p>You can add additional named setups using the Setup Configuration dialog box using the New or Duplicate options. 
    These configurations will be added to the active document and saved with the document. 
    The add-in will be able to retrieve and reuse these setups if the same model is being exported. 
    You can also rename and delete named setups from this dialog.</p>
    <p> The last two options are for experimental use and have fewer settable options than the rest.</p>


<h2 id="Install" name="Install">Installation and Uninstallation</h2>
<p>
The installer that ran when you downloaded this plug-in from Revit Exchange 
  has already installed the plug-in. You will need to restart Revit to activate 
  the plug-in.
</p>
<p>
To uninstall this plug-in, exit Revit if you are currently running it, 
  simply rerun the installer by downloading it again 
  from Exchange, and select the 'Uninstall' button, or you can uninstall it from 
  'Control Panel\Programs\Programs and Features' (Windows 7) or Add/Remove 
  Programs (Windows XP), just as you would uninstall any other application from 
  your system.

<h2 id="AdditionalInfo" name="AdditionalInfo">Additional Information</h2>
<p>
From Revit 2019 and onward the open source codes have been relocated to Github at the following address: <a href="https://github.com/Autodesk/revit-ifc" target=_blank>https://github.com/Autodesk/revit-ifc</a></p>
The older source code for this application (prior to 2019) is still available at the SourceForge project :
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/ifcexporter/home/Home/" target=_blank>http://sourceforge.net/p/ifcexporter/home/Home/</a></p>
<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<p>The alternate export UI is currently provided only in English, German and French.  The help is currently provided only in English.</p>
<p>The third party toolkit we use to write out IFC files has a limit on the maximum size of IFC file it can create.  
While there is no absolute metric for this, in practice it is about 1.5 GB.  The toolkit provider is aware of these issues and is 
working on expanding and eventually removing this limit, and we will be tracking their progress on this issue.</p>

				<li>Various improvements for consistent geometry (conforming to Euler formula)
			</ul>	
         <br>
       <p>

			<br>
      	<p>
         Known Issues:
			<ul>
				<li>Combination of a section box in the current view and the use of option <strong>Use active view when creating geometry</strong> may cause certain walls that are cut by the section box to fail during export resulting of missing some geometries. Workaround for this is to avoid using section box that cuts walls
				<li>In IFC4 RV export, several objects such as Walls, Floors, Roofs and Ceilings are exported using their layer parts as separate geometry items. However, due to the current limitation those objects that have their shape modified manually may not be exported with the layers.
