<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
This application seamlessly replaces the built-in IFC mechanism.  Please use the standard IFC import and export UI to access this functionality.</p>

The export alternate interface is loaded when users access the Export functionality using Revit UI. This alternate interface offers a flexible set of options to configure the export. The options include:</p>
<p>
<p><strong>IFC version</strong>:</p>
<menu>
<li>IFC 2x3 Coordination View 2.0</li>
<li>IFC 2x3 Coordination View</li>
<li>IFC 2x2 Coordination View</li>
<li>IFC 2x2 Singapore BCA e-Plan Check</li>
<li>IFC 2x3 GSA Concept Design BIM 2010 – This is a variant of the standard IFC 2x3 used for submitting files to the US Government Services Administration.  Additional property sets will be included.</li> 
<li>IFC 2x2 Singapore BCA e-Plan Check - This is a certified variant of IFC 2x2 used for submitting files to the Singapore BCA e-Plan Check Server. When exporting to this file type, you should make sure that all room-bounding elements are selected.</li
<li>IFC 4 Reference View</li>
<li>IFC 4 Design Transfer View</li>
</menu>
<p><strong>File Type</strong>: The file format</p>
<menu><li>IFC</li>
<li>IFC XML</li>
<li>Zipped IFC</li>
<li>Zipped IFC XML</li></menu>
<p><strong>Phase to export</strong>: Selects the phase of the document to export, defaulting to the last phase of the document.  If "Export only elements visible in view" is selected, the phase of the view will be used and this option greyed out.</p>
<p><strong>Space boundaries</strong>: The level of room/space boundaries exported:</p>
<menu>
<li>None – room/space boundaries are not exported</li>
<li>1st level – the room/space boundaries are included but are not optimized to split elements with respect to spaces on the opposite side of the boundary</li>
<li>2nd level – the room/space boundaries are included and are split with respect to spaces on the opposite side of the boundary</li>
</menu>
<p><strong>Project Origin</strong>: The origin of the exported file.  Can be one of:</p>
<menu>
<li>Current shared coordinates origin (default)</li>
<li>Internal Revit coordinates</li>
<li>Project Base Point</li>
<li>Site Survey Point</li>
</menu>

<p><strong>Export only elements visible in view</strong>: Checked to export only the visible elements of the current view (based on filtering and/or element and category hiding), unchecked to export the entire model.  
<p><strong>Export rooms in 3D views</strong>: If the "export only elements visible in view" is checked, checking this option will export all of the rooms that are contained inside the section box of the selected 3D view.  If there is no active section box, all rooms will be exported.
<p><strong>Export Bounding Box</strong>: Checked to export bounding box representations, Unchecked to exclude them.  This is the default for GSA export.</p>
<p><strong>Export Linked Files as Separate IFCs</strong>: Checked to export any Revit links in the project as separate IFCs, unchecked to exclude them.  Each linked instance in the file will export as a separate IFC file with the right positioning relative to the host file.  Multiple instances of the same linked document will export as separate files, identical except for their position and orientation.  Note that linked IFC files will be re-exported, so may suffer data loss on roundtrip.

<p><strong>Split walls and columns by Level</strong>: Whether or not to split walls and columns by building stories.</p>
<p><strong>Export 2D plan view elements</strong>: Checked to include 2D elements supported by IFC export (notes and filled regions), unchecked to exclude them. </p>

<p><strong>Export Revit property sets</strong>: Checked to include the Revit-specific property sets based on parameter groups.  Unchecked to exclude them.</p>
<p><strong>Export IFC Common property sets</strong>: Checked to include the IFC common property sets, unchecked to exclude them.</p>
<p><strong>Export Schedules as property sets</strong>: Checked to export schedules as custom property sets.  The name of the schedule is the property set name; the column names are the IFC parameter names.</p>
<p><strong>Export only schedules containing IFC, Pset, or Common in the title</strong>: When checked, restricts the schedules exported to only those that contain "IFC", "PSet", or "Common" in their title.
<p><strong>Export user defined property sets</strong>: Checked to export user-defined property set.  If checked, the use can specify the name of a text file that contains the property set definitions.</p>

<p><strong>Export base quantities</strong>: Whether or not to include base quantities for model elements in the export data.  Base quantities are generated from model geometry to reflect actual physical quantity values, independent of measurement rules or methods.</p>

<p><strong>Export parts as building elements</strong>: Checked to export parts as standard IFC elements, Unchecked to export them as IfcBuildingElementPart.</p>
<p><strong>Allow use of mixed "Solid Model" representation</strong>: Checked to allow for mixing BRep and extrusion geometries for an entity.  This can result in smaller IFC files, but which are not strictly within the standard IFC MVDs.</p>
<p><strong>Level of detail for some element geometry</strong>: Allows control of the level of tessellation for some Revit elements.  Disabling this option will generally result in larger, but more accurate, BRep and profile representations.  The main Revit elements affected by this control are: elbows, floors, pipe fittings, railings, ramps, spaces and stairs.  Highly detailed extrusion profiles are also affected.for these items.</p>
</p>
<p><strong>Use family and type name for references</strong>: Checked to use the family and type name for references, unchecked to use the type name only.</p>
<p><strong>Use 2D room boundaries for room volume</strong>: Checked to use a simplified approach to calculation of room volumes (based on extrusion of 2D room boundaries) which is also the default when exporting to IFC 2x2.   Unchecked to use the Revit calculated room geometry to represent the room volumes (which is the default when exporting to IFC 2x3).</p>
<p><strong>Include IFCSITE elevation in the site local placement origin</strong>: Checked to include the elevation from the Z offset of the IFCSITE local placement, unchecked to exclude it.</p>
<p><strong>Store IFC GUID in file after export</strong>: Optionally allow storing the generated IFC GUIDs into the project file after export. This will add "IFC GUID" parameters to elements and their types, and Project Information for Project, Site, and Building GUIDS. This requires v2.12 of the expoter to add the parameter values, and also requires a manual save. 
</p>

<p>There are 9 built-in setups in the user interface:</p>    
<menu>
<li>IFC 2x3 Coordination View 2.0</li>
<li>IFC 2x3 Coordination View</li>
<li>IFC 2x3 GSA Concept Design BIM 2010</li>
<li>IFC 2x3 Basic FM Handover View</li>
<li>IFC 2x3 Extended FM Handover View</li>
<li>IFC 2x2 Coordination View</li>
<li>IFC 2x2 Singapore BCA e-Plan Check</li>
<li>IFC 4 Reference View</li>
<li>IFC 4 Design Transfer View</li>

</menu>
    <p>These correspond to the file type options in the standard Revit UI. When selected, the individual options will adjust accordingly. 
    These setups cannot be modified or deleted, but they can be duplicated in order to create a modified version.</p>
    <p>The “In-Session Setup” is a modifiable setup which will not be saved between sessions. You can configure the options as desired.</p>
    <p>You can add additional named setups using the Setup Configuration dialog box using the New or Duplicate options. 
    These configurations will be added to the active document and saved with the document. 
    The add-in will be able to retrieve and reuse these setups if the same model is being exported. 
    You can also rename and delete named setups from this dialog.</p>
    <p> The last two options are for experimental use and have fewer settable options than the rest.</p>

<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<p>The alternate export UI is currently provided only in English and French.  The help is currently provided only in English.</p>
<p>The third party toolkit we use to write out IFC files has a limit on the maximum size of IFC file it can create.  
While there is no absolute metric for this, in practice it is about 1.5 GB.  The toolkit provider is aware of these issues and is 
working on expanding and eventually removing this limit, and we will be tracking their progress on this issue.</p>
