# Contributions

While we encourage contributions to the open source, we also want to make sure that we maintain our high quality standards for code that makes it into an official release. If you would be interested in contributing to the open source project, the following steps are necessary:

Please download and return the Autodesk Individual Open Source Agreement contract _here_ and return it to Angel Velez (angel.velez@autodesk.com).
Send Angel Velez a pull request so that we can review your changes.
The Open Source Steering Committee will meet to approve the proposed update.
Once approved, we will integrate your changes. We may make modifications based on any bugs found, or ask for quality-based updates on your contribution.
